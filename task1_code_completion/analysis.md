# Comparison of Manual and AI-Suggested Dictionary Sorting Implementations

Both implementations use Python’s `sorted` function with a lambda to sort a list of dictionaries by a specified key. The manual version is concise and assumes the key exists in all dictionaries. The AI-suggested code adds error handling for `KeyError`, making it more robust for invalid inputs, which is valuable in production environments. However, the AI version introduces slight overhead due to the try-except block, though this is negligible for small lists.

Efficiency-wise, both have O(n log n) time complexity due to Python’s Timsort algorithm. The AI version’s error handling adds minimal runtime overhead but improves reliability. For large datasets, the manual version might be marginally faster if key existence is guaranteed. However, the AI version’s defensive programming aligns better with real-world scenarios where data integrity isn’t assured. Copilot’s suggestion required minor tweaking (e.g., refining the error message), indicating it accelerates coding but isn’t perfect. The AI version is preferred for its robustness, though developers must review suggestions to ensure alignment with requirements.
