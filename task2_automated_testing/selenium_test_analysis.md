# Selenium Test Automation Analysis

The Selenium script automates login page testing for both valid and invalid credentials, verifying the presence of a "Welcome" message to determine successful login. The test results showed a 50% success rate: valid credentials passed, while invalid credentials failed, aligning with expected behavior.

AI-enhanced tools, such as Testim.io, improve test coverage by generating additional test cases based on user behavior patterns, reducing the need for manual script writing. Unlike manual testing, which is constrained by human foresight, AI analyzes application flows to identify edge cases, such as empty inputs or special characters. This approach enhances coverage for complex scenarios, including cross-browser compatibility and session timeouts.

Additionally, Selenium IDE with AI plugins suggests optimizations, such as prioritizing high-risk test cases, which saves time. However, AI may overgenerate tests, necessitating human review to eliminate redundancies.

Overall, AI-driven testing provides broader, faster, and more reliable test coverage compared to manual methods.
